# Legend
# http://www.r-graph-gallery.com/119-add-a-legend-to-a-plot/

# Create data:
a=c(1:5)
b=c(5,3,4,5,5)
c=c(4,5,4,3,1)

# Make a basic graph
plot( b~a , type="b" , bty="l" , xlab="value of a" , ylab="value of b" , col=rgb(0.2,0.4,0.1,0.7) , lwd=3 , pch=17 , ylim=c(1,5) )
lines(c ~a , col=rgb(0.8,0.4,0.1,0.7) , lwd=3 , pch=19 , type="b" )

# Add a legend
legend("bottomleft", 
       legend = c("Group 1", "Group 2"), 
       col = c(rgb(0.2,0.4,0.1,0.7), 
               rgb(0.8,0.4,0.1,0.7)), 
       pch = c(17,19), 
       bty = "n", 
       pt.cex = 2, 
       cex = 1.2, 
       text.col = "black", 
       horiz = F , 
       inset = c(0.1, 0.1))

#options
# topright : where do you want to add the legend ? You can put : “bottomright”, “bottom”, “bottomleft”, “left”, “topleft”, “top”, “topright”, “right”, “center”).
# legend = c(“name1”, “name2”) : names you want to show.
# col = c(“red”, “blue”) : colors of the symbols
# pch = 15 : type of symbols (see graph # to know what symbol number you need
# ty = “n” : If you don’t want a box around the legend. Write “o” if you want one
# pt.cex = 2 : Size of the symbols
# cex = 0.8 : Size of the text
# text.col = “black” : color of the text
# horiz = TRUE : legend in column or in row ?
# inset = c(0.1, 0.1) : % (from 0 to 1) to draw the legend away from x and y axis
# You can also give the X and Y coordinate of the legend: legend(3, 5, legend = c(“A”, “B”))
